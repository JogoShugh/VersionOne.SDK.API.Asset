# VersionOne.SDK.API.Asset

Lightweight client to access VersionOne's api/asset endpoint for all your Asset query, create, update, and operation execution needs.

## Status
This is a work-in-progress and needs significant work, especially around the area of fluent filtering. Pull-requests are more than welcome!

## More info
See [VersionOne Bulk API Docs and automated tests](https://github.com/versionone/asset_api_tests/tree/master/docs) for more information about the 
`api/asset` endpoint itself and how to use it.
